# premium-notes-app
The main goal of this project is for me to learn about the DevOps methodology and AWS tools. The code is not so complex but not so simple either. Premium Notes App is a full-stack web app (React + TailwindCSS; Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL) that lets users manage and share notes. It offers a Free Plan and a Premium Plan (integrated with Stripe).
